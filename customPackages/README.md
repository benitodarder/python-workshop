# Custom packages

This is a sample custom package creation/installation and some verification programs.

* To install the package: pip install <Path to packages folder> --user
    - --user to avoid disturbing system wide modules/packages
* To check package is present: pip freeze
* To uninstall: pip uninstall <package name, as defined in setup.py>
